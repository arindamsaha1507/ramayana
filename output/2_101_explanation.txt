On listening to Rama, Bharata replied Of what use shall be these royal duties to me, when I have fallen from righteousness?

O best of men there is an ancient tradition in our race that the younger son cannot become king when the eldest is there.

Therefore, O scion of the Raghu race, return along with me to prosperous Ayodhya and for the good of our race get your self coronated.

Other think the king to be a human, but to me, he is divine since his conduct and the statecraft are superhuman as they are in conformity with righteousness.

While I was in Kekaya and you took refuge in the forest, venerable king (Dasaratha), who was always engaged in sacrifices and was held in high esteem by the virtuous, ascended to heaven.

As soon as you set out for the forest along with Sita and Lakshmana, the king, overwhelmed with grief, attained heaven.

Arise, O best of men and offer libations to our father. I and Satrughna have already done so.

O son of Raghu's race, it is said that whatever is offered by a dear son becomes eternal in the world of manes. You alone are the beloved son of our father.

Your father, deprived of you, brooding over you, wishing to behold you, unable to divert his mind fixed on you, remembering you alone and immersed in sorrow departed (from this world).  इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अयोध्याकाण्डे एकोत्तर शततम स्सर्गः।।  Thus ends the hundredone sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
