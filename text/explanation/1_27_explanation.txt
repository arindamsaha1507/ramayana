The night over, illustrious Viswamitra called Rama with a sweet smile.

O Rama mightyarmed prince, receive these mighty and highly exalted astras capable of assuming at once any form at will".

Viswamitra, the greatest ascetic after the purification ritual stood with his face turned east and happily, conferred on Rama collection of the unique mantras.

The sage offered Rama the complete collection of those weapons which even the celestials find it difficult to acquire.

While the sagacious ascetic Viswamitra was muttering the mystic terms of these venerable astras (addressing their respective deities), all these weapons (with their mystic power) attended on Rama.

The munificient presiding deities of the weapons with folded palms addressed these words to Rama saying, "Here we are, at you disposal ".

Rama received the astras he felt with his hands and commanded them saying, "Live in my mind" (serve me whenever I remember you).

Thereafter, the cheerful Rama, bowed to the mighty ascetic Viswamitra and commenced his journey.  इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे सप्तविंशस्सर्गः।।  Thus ends the twentyseventh sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
