The courageous son of the Windgod, Hanuman, the vanara saw the aerial chariot kept in the middle of the mansion inlaid with gems and diamonds latticed with artificial windows of barnished gold.

The immeasurable Pushpaka fashioned by Visvakarma with images of incomparable  beauty was not possible to describe. An excellent product of his achievement, it was placed in the aerial path appearing as a beaconlight (signpost) in the orbit of the Sun.

There was nothing in Pushpaka which was not executed carefully with special effort, nothing which was not made of precious stones. Such privileges were not available to even gods. Indeed there was nothing which was not unique.

(The Pushpaka) was designed by dint of divine efforts and prowess (of Kubera). It could touch any place its master commanded with a cool mind. It had many beautiful  places of rest.

The Pushpaka was specially designed in a unique manner. It was decorated with many colourful peaks. It was delghtful and pleasing to the mind and bright like the autumnal fullmoon. It looked like a mountain with many wonderful towers around.

The Pushpaka was borne by multitudes of Bhutas whose faces were shining with earrings, who were demons ranging in the night sky. They were gluttons endowed with great speed, and they had big, rolling and frightening eyes.

That hero among monkeys, beheld the aerial chariot looking beautiful like a colourful collection of spring blossoms. Its appearance was more pleasant than spring itself.  इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये सुन्दरकाण्डे अष्टमस्सर्गः।।  Thus ends the eighth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
