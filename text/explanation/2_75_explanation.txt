On regaining his senses after a long time, the valiant Bharata looked at his unfortunate mother whose eyes were filled with tears, and condemned her amidst the counsellors.

Neither did I ever desire the kingdom nor did I ever consult my mother in this regard and I am not even aware of the consecration that was planned by the king for I was away in a distant country with Satrughna.

I knew nothing of the banishment of great Rama nor did I know how Lakshmana or Sita had gone on exile.

As magnanimous Bharata was wailing, Kausalya recognised his voice and said to Sumitraः

Bharata, the farsighted son of Kaikeyi of cruel deeds has come and I wish to see him.

Having said so to Sumitra, Kausalya trembling and almost lifeless, emaciated, sullied and turned pallid set out for the place where Bharat was.

But at the same time Bharata, the younger brother of Rama accompanied by Satrughna proceeded to the place where Kausalya resided.

Then agonised Bharata and Satrughna, beholding that venerable, noblehearted, griefstricken, weeping Kausalya who was almost semiconscious overcome with grief, approached her with great sorrow and hugged her.

Looking at Bharata, the deeply afflicted Kausalya said, The kingdom which you had desired has been acquired without any obstacle. Alas Kaikeyi had quickly secured it for you through her crooked act.

What advantage did cruel Kaikeyi visualize in sending away my son to dwell in the forest wearing robes of bark?

Kaikeyi should send me also without any delay to that place where my illustrious  Rama with golden navel dwells.

Or else I, accompanied by Sumitra, shall go happily on my own holding the sacred fire in front to that place where Rama dwells.

Or, you should now take me personally to that place where, my son Rama, the best among men, is performing austerities.

This vast kingdom, with all its abundance of wealth and grain, elephants, horses and chariots has been delivered to you by her.

Thus reproached by many a harsh word, like needle pricking a wound, the sinless Bharata was intensely pained.

(Having heard these words), his senses reeling, he became unconscious, lamented profusaly and fell at her feet. And on regaining his senses, he stood motionless.

As Kausalya was lamenting in this manner, overwhelmed with deep grief, Bharata, his palms joined in reverence, replied her in these wordsः

O noble lady unaware (of what had happened), I am guiltless. Why do you upbraid me? You know well my profound, steadfast affection for Raghava (Rama).

Did not the one who counselled the banishment of my noble brother who is steadfast and bound by truth and virtue, ever adhered to scriptures?  (or)  My noble brother (Rama), the best among the virtuous, bound to truth, is banished. Let not such thought occur at any time to one who steadfastly adheres to scriptures

While thus appeasing Kausalya deprived of her husband and son, Bharata, filled with grief, fell down at her feet.

Kausalya said these words to Bharata who fell unconscious, consumed with grief, while swearing on painful oaths.

O son by swearing on oaths, you are choking the very breath of my life and my suffering has grown still more.

O dear child, fortunately your mind is unswerved from righteousness. You being truthful to your promise shall attain the world of virtuous men along with Lakshmana.

After having addressed Bharata, who was affectionate towards his brother that way, Kausalya drew the mightyarmed one onto her lap and hugged him and cried out with extreme grief.

Afflicted by sorrow and lamenting thus, great Bharata's mind became unsteady owing to swooning and besieged by grief.

That night passed off in grief for Bharata, who fell on the ground with his mind clouded and his senses lost. He lamented again and again, heaving deep, warm sighs.  इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अयोध्याकाण्डे पञ्चसप्ततितमस्सर्गः।।  Thus ends the seventyfifth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
